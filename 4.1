*4.1 (Count positive and negative numbers and compute the average of numbers) Write
a program that reads an unspecified number of integers, determines how many
positive and negative values have been read, and computes the total and average of
the input values (not counting zeros). Your program ends with the input 0. Display
the average as a floating-point number. Here is a sample run:
Enter an integer, the input ends if it is 0: 1 2 -1 3 0
The number of positives is 3
The number of negatives is 1
The total is 5
The average is 1.25

Enter an integer, the input ends if it is 0:0
No numbers are entered except 0


import java.util.Scanner;

public class java { 
  public static void main(String[] args){ 
  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
  
  System.out.print("Enter an integer, the input ends if it is 0: ");  
  double x = input.nextDouble();
  double sum = 0;
  int n = 0;
  double average = 0;
  int positive = 0;
  int negative = 0;
  while (x != 0) {
    n++;
    sum = sum + x;
    average = sum / n;
    if (x > 0) {
    positive = positive + 1;
    }
    else
    negative = negative + 1;
    x = input.nextDouble();
  }
  
  if (n != 0) {
  System.out.println("The number of positives is " + positive);
  System.out.println("The number of negatives is " + negative);
  System.out.println("The total is " + sum);
  System.out.println("The average is " + average);  
  }
  else
  System.out.println("No numbers are entered except 0");

 } 
}
